## Psychic-Game

### Synopsis
***

A letter guessing app I created that features dynamically updated HTML powered by JavaScript code.  The app randomly picks a letter from A to Z and allows you to guess the letter up to 9 times each attempt.  The app keeps track of your wins and losses, until you refresh or leave the page.
